# TabbedJFrame
Very simple Tabbed JFrame GUI application created in IntellJ's designer, with one class per tab; purpose is to demonstrate splitting code from each tab into a separate class. 

Each tab was created as a GUI form, with all components added to a single JPanel. This JPanel can be added to the JTabbedPane in the main GUI form.

You could use the same principle to write code in a separate class for any GUI component.
